Setting up a Normal Quake TeamFortress server
=---------------------------------------------=
TF has a few options that can be tweaked by the server. In QW,
we can do a lot with the serverinfo keys, but in normal quake
we're restricted to using the "temp1" variable and cfg files.

N.B. If you're setting up a QuakeWorld server, don't read this file.
     Read qwserver.txt instead.

=---------------=
First, various toggleable options can be set on the server, using
the "temp1" variable.
"temp1" has a series of bits:
			Class Persistance			1
            Speed Cheat Checking        2
			5 Second Respawn Delay 		4
			Autoteam On					64	
			TeamFrags On				128	
			SpyInvis On					512	
			Grapple On					1024
            FullTeamScore               2048
            Flag Emulation On           4096
            Use War Standard On         8192

Simply add up all the bits you want to set, and then set "temp1" to
the final value. If any bit is NOT set, then that option is OFF.
For example, if you wanted to have the grappling hook, autoteaming, and
spyinvis on, in the console you would type 
	"temp1 1600" 
because 64 + 512 + 1024 = 1600.

Descriptions are as follows:
CLASS PERSISTANCE
    If it's ON, then during Co-Op modes players will retain their 
    class over level changes.

SPEED CHEAT CHECKING
    If it's ON, then player's movement speeds will be checked regularly
    to make sure they're not moving faster than they should be, due to
    class constraints, etc. 

AUTOTEAM
    If it's ON, players who join will automatically be assigned to the 
    team with the lowest number of players in it.

TEAMFRAGS
    If it's ON, player's frags will always be equal to their team's score.

FULLTEAMSCORE
    If it's ON, player's frags will always be equal to their team's score.

SPY INVIS
    If it's ON, Spies become invisible when they go undercover.
    If it's OFF, Spies change their skin/color when they go undercover.

GRAPPLE
    If it's OFF, players will never have access to it. If it's ON,
    players will have access to it on maps that don't forbid it.

RESPAWN 
    If it's ON, players can't respawn for 5 seconds after dying.
    
FLAG EMULATION
    When this is on, TF will replace any TF goals using the 
    old Quake keys for flags with the new TF Flag. Good to turn
    on for the old TF maps, like 2fort4.

USE WAR STANDARD
    When this is on, TF will replace any TF Flags with the 
    new TF War Standard.

=---------------=
Second, the teamplay options can be set using the teamplay variable,
which is also a bitfield, as follows:

	Bit 1:	    Teamplay On.
	Bit 2:	    Team-members take 1/2 damage from direct fire.
	Bit 4:	    Team-members take No damage from direct fire.
	Bit 8:	    Team-members take 1/2 damage from area-affect weaponry.
	Bit 16:	    Team-members take No damage from area-affect weaponry.
	Bit 32:     Team Equalisation : give advantage to team with less members.
	Bit 64:     Team Equalisation : give advantage to team with lower score.
	Bit 128:	Team-members only lose 1/2 armor from direct fire.
	Bit 256:	Team-members lose no armor from direct fire.
	Bit 512:	Team-members only lose 1/2 armor from area-affect weaponry.
	Bit 1024:	Team-members lose no armor from area-affect weaponry.
    Bit 2048:   Team-members take 1/2 mirror damage from direct fire.
    Bit 4096:   Team-members take full mirror damage from direct fire.
    Bit 8192:   Team-members take 1/2 mirror damage from area-affect weaponry.
    Bit 16384:  Team-members take full mirror damage from area-affect weaponry.

Area Effect Weaponry
	Anything which explodes, hurting people in an area around it.
	e.g. Rocket blasts, grenades.

Direct Fire
	Anything which does damage directly.
	e.g. Shotguns, rifles, assault cannon.

For example, if you wanted to have teammates take 1/2 damage from 
area effects, No damage from direct fire, and full team equalisation,
/you'd set "teamplay 109" (1 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 64 = 109).

The Team Equilisation gives an advantage to a team by altering the
amount of damage they do and take.  It is designed to be subtle, but
it can still help the losing team fight back. Not good for tournaments
though.

=---------------=
Class Changing
    By default, once players have chosen a class, they can't change again.
    The server can allow players to change classes during a game by setting
    the "deathmatch" variable to 3.

=---------------=
Finally, the maps the server can cycle through are now defined in cfg files.
Create a directory under the quake\fortress directory called "mcycle".
In this directory you can put cfg files that the patch will use.
Each cfg file should be called "mapX.cfg", where X is the map number in
the map loop. 
E.g. If you wanted to cycle between three maps (2fort_32, storm1, well6), you 
	 would make 3 cfg files as follows:
		map1.cfg	which contains the following line:
						changelevel 2fort_32
		map2.cfg	which contains the following line:
						changelevel storm1
		map3.cfg	which contains the following line:
						changelevel well6
	
NOTE! At the end of the list, you _MUST_ create another cfg file,
which consists of one line which sets samelevel to 0.

E.g. in the above example, you would also need this:
		map4.cfg	which contains the following line:
						samelevel 0

And last, you must put a changelevel command in your server.cfg file which
changes map to the first map in the list, and a samelevel 1 to prevent
the first map playing twice
E.g. in the above example, at the end of your server.cfg you would put:
		changelevel 2fort_32
		samelevel 1

There is no limit to the number of maps you can cycle between. You can also
use the cfg file to change any server details. Lets say that in the above
example, you wanted a respawn delay on storm1, and no respawn delay on the
rest.
You would change the following files:
		map2.cfg	would become:
						temp1 4
						changelevel storm1
		map3.cfg	would become:
						temp1 0
						changelevel well6

If you want to make a server rerun the same level over and over again,
you will still have to make a map1.cfg that contains a changelevel command, and
a map2.cfg that sets samelevel 0.
	
N.B. Make sure all the maps in the list are spelt correctly and that they
     are in your server's map directory. If they're not, the server will 
     crash when it tries to enter the map.

N.B. The samelevel variable stores the current map number in the list. If
	 you want to jump around the levels, you can just set samelevel to 
	 (desired level number - 1).
	 e.g. if you wanted to jump to map 3 in the list, enter this:
				samelevel 2
	 	  and then end the level.
