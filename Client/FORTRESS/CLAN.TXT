Setting up a QW TeamFortress server for a Clan Battle
=----------------------------------------------------=
Running a QW Clan Battle with TF should be a lot easier now.
Make sure you've read the qwserver.txt file before you read this.

As usual, there's abbreviations for all the localinfo keys,
even though QW 2.0 has made them pretty redundant.

=--------------=
Turning on Clan Mode

    To access all the Clan Battle settings, you need to put TF into
    Clan Mode, using the "clan" localinfo key.
        "localinfo clan on"
        "localinfo c on"			// Abbreviation

=--------------=
Clan Names
    You can replace the "blue", "red", etc team names that TF enforces,
    so you can have your Clan's name for the team.
    Read the qwserver.txt file for details on how to do it.

Clan Skins
    You can allow individual teams to use different skins.
    This is useful in Clan Battles if each clan has it's own
    set of skins for the TF classes. It's not a good idea to
    play with Clan skins unless each Clan has recognisable
    skins for all classes.
    The change the skins used, set the following localinfo
    keys. Any keys that aren't set will simply use the base
    TF skins.

        Team 1 Skins              Team 2 Skins
            sk_t1_scout               sk_t2_scout
            sk_t1_sniper              sk_t2_sniper
            sk_t1_soldier             sk_t2_soldier
            sk_t1_demoman             sk_t2_demoman
            sk_t1_medic               sk_t2_medic
            sk_t1_hwguy               sk_t2_hwguy
            sk_t1_pyro                sk_t2_pyro
            sk_t1_spy                 sk_t2_spy
            sk_t1_engineer            sk_t2_engineer

        Team 3 Skins              Team 4 Skins
            sk_t3_scout               sk_t4_scout
            sk_t3_sniper              sk_t4_sniper
            sk_t3_soldier             sk_t4_soldier
            sk_t3_demoman             sk_t4_demoman
            sk_t3_medic               sk_t4_medic
            sk_t3_hwguy               sk_t4_hwguy
            sk_t3_pyro                sk_t4_pyro
            sk_t3_spy                 sk_t4_spy
            sk_t3_engineer            sk_t4_engineer

    E.g. If one clan had a new scout skin called "our_scout", and 
         they were playing as Team 1, you'd set the svr's key:
             "localinfo sk_t1_scout our_scout"

=--------------=
PreMatch Time

    A PreMatch time period can be specified by setting the "prematch"
    localinfo key to the time period, in minutes.
        "localinfo prematch 10"    // 10 Minute PreMatch time
        "localinfo pm 10"			// Abbreviation
        
    During the PreMatch time, players can run around and shoot each
    other, but they can't pick up anything, drop anything, use special
    class abilities, etc. 
    They can access the usual TF information commands, such as showclasses,
    inv, flaginfo, etc.
    They can also change class, even if the deathmatch variable is not set
    to 3. So, if you want to allow class changing during the PreMatch time,
    but not during the Match, then don't set the deathmatch variable to 3.
    Players get regular messages telling them how long it is until the match
    begins. Once it begins, all players are killed once to ensure all the
    teams restart in their bases.
    N.B. If you have a timelimit for your match, make sure you add the 
         prematch time to it. For example, if you wanted a 30 minute game,
         with a 5 minute PreMatch time, you'd set the "prematch" key to 5,
         and "timelimit" to 35.
         If your timelimit is set to less that the PreMatch time TF will 
         set the timelimit to be the current timelimit plus the Prematch 
         time.
         e.g. If your prematch time is 5 minutes, and your timelimit is 2,
              it'd set the timelimit to 7 minutes.

Cease Fire Time
    A Ceasefire time period can be specified by setting the 
    "ceasefire_time localinfo key to the time period, in minutes.
        "localinfo ceasefire_time 10"    // 10 Minute CeaseFire time
        "localinfo cft 10"			      // Abbreviation

    During this time period, players will not be able to move
    or shoot.         
    N.B. The same time rules for the PreMatch time period apply to
         the Ceasefire time period. 
         But, the Ceasefire time period must be less than or
         equal to the PreMatch time.


=--------------=
Class Restrictions
    Check out the qwserver.txt file for info on how to restrict the number
    of players on any team using a particular class.

=--------------=
Player Substitutions
    Players that are disconnected during a Clan battle can rejoin and 
    continue playing. They will automatically have their team, class,
    and frags restored when they rejoin.
    Players can also sub in for a disconnected player.
    This is done as follows:
      When a player joins a Clan game, they're given a Battle ID.
      The player will be told "Your Battle ID is X", when X is a number.
      When a player is disconnected, TF keeps a note of their Battle ID.
      When a player rejoins, TF checks to see if the player has a Battle ID.
      If they have, it checks to see if it matches someone who's disconnected,
      and if it does match, it restores the player.
      If they haven't got a Battle ID, or their ID doesn't match any 
      disconnected players, then it either doesn't allow them in the game,
      or it lets them start as normal, depending on the state of the 
      "locked_game" localinfo variable (see below).

      Now, when a player initially joins the game, their Battle ID is 
      stored inside the _player's_ "tf_id" setinfo key, so if they're
      disconnected, they can reconnect just fine.
      But, if that player loses connection completely, and can't rejoin,
      another player can substitute for them. To do this, you need to 
      set your "tf_id" setinfo key to the Battle ID of the disconnected
      player.
      Since the player who dropped off may have lost net access, we allow
      anyone on a team to find the Battle ID's of anyone on their team
      using the "showids" command.

    "showids"
      This command will show you a list of all your team mates and their
      Battle IDs. It will also show you a list of Battle IDs of players
      on your team who've disconnected... but it _won't_ show you their
      names.
      The reason for this is because we can't. Quake releases the string
      containing the player's name when they disconnect, and there's nothing
      we can do about it.
      You should get by without any trouble tho... there's usually only one
      or two player's who are disconnected at any time.

      Once you've got the Battle ID of a disconnected player who you want
      to sub in for, the player has to set his/her "tf_id" setinfo key
      to that value.
      E.g. If the Battle ID of the disconnected player is 56, then the
           substitute would type this command at his/her console:
                setinfo tf_id 56
      Once set, the substitute can join the game, and he/she'll take over
      for the disconnected player.

    Note that even if a disconnected player doesn't rejoin, and no-one
    subs in for them, their score will still be kept for the final scores.

=--------------=
Game Locking
    A server can be locked to prevent anyone joining the game after the
    PreMatch time is over, using the following:
    
    	"localinfo locked_game on"
    	"localinfo lg on"              // Abbreviation

    Players who are disconnected will still be able to rejoin, as will
    substitutes for disconnected players.

=--------------=
ScreenShots
    Any player in a clan battle who sets his/her infokey "take_sshot"
    to "on" will automatically have a screenshot of the end game scores
    taken for them.

        "setinfo take_sshot on"

    This will automatically write the screenshot for you when the game ends.

=--------------=
The Scoring System
    The scoring system has been enhanced a fair bit to make sure that the
    final scores shown are accurate. There's a few little details you
    should be aware of.

    Unaccounted Frags
        If a player disconnects, and never returns, his/her frags are not
        lost. They will be included in the final score, and you'll also
        be shown the number of unaccounted frags each team had.

    Score Tweaking
        When the game ends, the scores of each player are changed. 
        After this is done, the "Team" scores shown by the QW client
        at the top of the screen will _always_ be a perfectly accurate
        display of the Total Score for each Team.
        The way the scores are changed depends on the scoring method
        being used.

        - Normal Scoring
            In normal scoring, the only score tweaking done is the
            distribution of unaccounted frags. If team 1 has 20 
            unaccounted frags at the end of the game, they're 
            distributed as evenly as possible between all the members
            of Team 1.

        - TeamFrags and FullTeamScore
            In these two modes, all the members of the same team has
            identical frags. 
            E.g. During the game, if Team 1 has a TeamScore of 23, 
                 all players in Team 1 will have 23 frags.

            When the game ends, all the members of each Team have their
            frags tweaked so that the total of the Team's member's frags
            adds upto their TeamScore.
            E.g. If, at the end of the game, Team 1 had a TeamScore of
                 55, then all the members of Team 1 would have their frags
                 altered so that their total adds upto 55.

        Score Tweaking can be turned off by setting the following 
        localinfo key:
            localinfo "dont_tweak_frags" "on"
            localinfo "dtf" "on"               // Abbreviation
        Personally, I advise you definately don't turn off frag tweaking...
        if you do, the final Team Score shown by the QW Client won't 
        be accurate.

    Team Details
        Each Team's details are also dumped to the console for anyone
        who wants to see them. E.g. for Team 1 you might see this:
		    =------= TEAM1 RESULTS =------=
            8 players.
            123 frags, 13 unaccounted for.
            40 team score.
